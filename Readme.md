This is my answer to the test's questions.

Time: the construction of the algorithms, the creation of the repository and the readme file as well as the written file in which I answer the other questions that were asked during the meeting, took me 9 hours.


The two problems where:
Q1. Rahul is a software engineer working on a module where he has to generate names of people with each character repeating only once and each name being unique from the others.
Given an integer K, he creates K unique names for Rahul. (Make sure each character in the name is repeated only once.)
Also, each name must be a minimum of four in length.
Q2. Rahul is a software engineer working on a module where he has to generate names of people with each character repeating only once and each name being unique from the others.
Given the integers K and L, create K unique texts of length L for Rahul. (Make sure each character in the name is repeated only once.)

Question Q1 is answered by the k_names algorithm in the K_Names.py file. Likewise the question Q2 is answered by the kl_names algorithm in the KL_Names.py file.

Execution: My answer can be tested by executing the k_names and kl_names algorithms from any python program as well as from the console interface provided in the file main.py whose execution through the command "$ python .\main.py" immediately displays such Interface

Editing the alphabet: the alphabet.py file contains only a string object which contains the characters used to generate the diferent names. You can add or remove the elements you want and that suldn't affect the functioning of the algorithm.
